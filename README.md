I found a schematic From Tom Gamble/EFM for a Korg 770 VCF. I always liked the way these old Korgs sounded so I tried to make a Frac Format VCF out of his design.

The result sounded not too good, so I gave up. I am putting all the kicad, gerbers, etc., here.

if someone wants to keep working on it, have at it. I am probably not going to.
